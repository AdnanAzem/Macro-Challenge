# Macro-Challenge

## OverFlow
In this project we recieved 3 csv file:
<ol>
  <li>train_dataset.csv</li>
  <li>validation_dataset.csv</li>
  <li>test_dataset_without_labels.csv</li>
</ol>
and the target is to classify the data into white or mal.<br><br>

<b>What is VBA Code?</b><br>
VBA coding refers toÂ writing instructions in the Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) language to create macros, automate tasks, and add custom functionality to Excel.<br><br>
<b>What is macro?</b><br>
A macro is an action or a set of actions that you can run as many times as you want.<br><br>
<b>Importance in Cybersecurity</b><br>
VBA code malware poses a significant threat to organizations as it can be used to deliver malware, steal sensitive information, and compromise system security. Detecting and mitigating VBA code malware is crucial to protecting against cyberattacks and ensuring the integrity of computer systems and data.<br>


### Dataset
The dataset contains two columns:
<ol>
  <li>
    vba_code: contains a code that is written in vba.
  </li>
  <li>
    label: contains two values white or mal
  </li>
</ol>

### Data Preprocessing
<ul>
  <li>
    Basic and extended text cleaning for normalization.
  </li>
  <li>
    Handling of hexadecimal strings to address obfuscation.
  </li>
  <li>
    TF-IDF Vectorization: Applied with and without `max_features` to refine feature relevance.
  </li>
</ul>

### Features Extraction
We extract 4 more features from the dataset:
<ol>
  <li>character count</li>
  <li>lines count</li>
  <li>token count</li>
  <li>length of the maximum token</li>
</ol>

### Model Training
The dataset was splited for us we recived a train file for training the data and validation file for testing the data.<br>
We use a RandomForest Model to train the data with 2 prametres:
<ol>
  <li>n_estimators = 100</li>
  <li>random_state = 42</li>
</ol>

### Handling False Positives and Negatives
<ol>
  <li>Basic TF-IDF: 99.39% accuracy.</li>
  <li>TF-IDF with `max_features=1000`: 99.46% accuracy.</li>
  <li>Hexadecimal preprocessing: 99.51% accuracy.</li>
  <li>Addition of textual features: 99.62% accuracy.
</li>
</ol>

### Final Result:

### How to Run:
<ol>
  <li>Open CMD</li>
  <li>Run the command: python train.py</li>
  <li>Run the command: python inference.py</li>
</ol>
